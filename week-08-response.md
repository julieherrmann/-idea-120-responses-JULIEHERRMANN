# Consuming Media
<p> Chalabi and O'Neil each outline the problems with highly targeted data that aims to influence specific subsets of populations. In Chalabi's Ted Talk, she references how and when we are able to trust statistics, and how the reports that come from the analysis of different statistics often aim to convey a biased message. She uses the example of "X% of Muslims support Jihad", which is a frightening statistic for many that caters to biases of Islamophobia, when in reality, reporters ignored one of the other questions surveyed, which was to define Jihad. Because the audience is not seeing the larger context in which the statistics were created, we only have a limited view of what isd being reported on. In O'Neil's chapter, she discusses the way that ads are used to funnel potential buyers in a direction they would not normally go, and it has worked so seemlessly that those producing the ads feel as though customers are benefitting from the targetted approach, since they are only seeing what is "relevant." She uses the example of a venture capitalist that gave a talk about the brilliant future of targeted advetersing, mentioning that he would not have to see Univeristy of Phoenix ads anymore. Because University of Phoenix offers budget-friendly tuition and accesibility, their ads targeted impoverished familes, preying on the idea that those facing poverty were not doing enough with their lives; O'Neil describes these types of ads as predatory. </p>
<p> Personally, I believe that targeted data and advertising has the potential to be helpful, but has ultimately created circles in which populations are placed in conflict with one another based off of the biased information they have received. There is a sense of trust in the internet, that it is a democratic space for everyone, but because our attention spans have decreased and the amount of information we intake has increased, these seemingly insignifanct and fleeting ads or statistics end up having a greater impact on our society as a whole. Although an algorithm might conclude that I need new skincare products based on my search history, and Instagram "helps" by recommending a relevant product directly to my feed, it cuts out the process of vetting the product through customer reviews and specific needs that I would go through by searching for that product myself, and the company with the largest advertising budget comes out on top regardless of how good their product is. Further, if I see an article pop up that 9 out of 10 (insert my demographic by age, gender, location, etc.) have benefitted from this product, I'm more likely to buy it because it feels personally connected to my identity and needs. Finding truth in the sea of the internet is incredibly difficult, especially when methods of reporting fact are being obscured, so I believe it is healthy to question what is being shown to you and always dig deeper. </p>
