# Anthropy Questions
<p> - What are the main differences and similarities between digital games and folk games?
<P> - How far can the definition of game expand?
<p> - Is storytelling as important as problem-solving in games?

<p> Digital games vary from folk games in one glaring way; One is played in real life, and one is played through a screen, but Anthropy offers the idea that digital-folk games still exist. For example, both Tetris and Snake have been recreated so many different times with small variations that the original author of the game has become detached. Though there is an original developer and an original version of the game, it has been passed down like a game of telephone until the author becomes unimportant. To that end, I would argue that any game, digital or physical, can become a folk game if enough time has passed and enough variations have been made. However, with the nuanced nature of video games becoming more narrative-based and reflective of the sociohistorical context they are created in, the element of recreation or de-authorizing becomes harder </p>
  <P> When games include elements of storytelling, the author of the game is considered as a point of perspective. As Anthropy discussed in Ch. 1-2, games created by white males usually appeal to other white males, which ends up being the demographic; This goes for any other dmeographic creating games that relate to the self in some way. By contrast, the rules and experience of folk games such as Tag don't provoke the player to find out who created the game, as it lacks in any human experience that progresses outside of rules of movement. The more specific of any experience the player is asked to engage with in a game, the more the author of that game becomes relevant, hence making it more difficult for that game to become detached from its author and become what we consider a "folk game"</p>
<p> With that being said, I feel that the types of games that become "folk" games have either one of two different elements; 1. They are removed from anything related to the human experience entirely (i.e., tag is not a situation one would find themselves in outside of gameplay, just as tetris is not an action that relates to anything in real life) or 2. They encompass a collective human experience. Though I can't think of a concrete example, I could see a narrative digital game becoming a folk game if the set of rules was connected to something that everyone was able to relate to. Maybe one day, life-simulators like Sims will be considered folk games since they are reflective of the real-world in a way that lets you create your OWN narrative, rather than bringing an authored experience into question. </p>
