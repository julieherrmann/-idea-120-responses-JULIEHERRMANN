# BINARY
*Like the rib of Adam conjuring Eve, the lonely coder beckons her to life,*

*Filling void of the feminine, responding at beck and call.*

*Sheâ€™s been called many names by now- _Eliza, A.L.I.C.E, Alexa, Siri_-*

*Yet always pulling delicate truth from null, flaunting imagined womanly flair,*

*As if her creator is concerned with a different binary.*
