# BINARY
*Like the rib of Adam conjuring Eve, the lonely coder beckons her to life,

Filling void of the feminine, responding at beck and call.

Sheâ€™s been called many names by now- Eliza, A.L.I.C.E, Alexa, Siri-

Yet always pulling delicate truth from null, flaunting imagined womanly flair

As if her creator is concerned with a different binary.*
