# WMD- Pandemic Taxes Debacle

<p>One example of a WMD that I have personally experienced is what happened with unemployment taxes last year. Due to the pandemic, millions of Americans lost their jobs in 2020 and had to file for unemployment. In my case, and the case of many others in college living with their families, I lost my part-time minimum wage job, and the unemployment benefits were larger checks than I had ever encountered. In order to keep receiving unemployment benefits, I decided to file my taxes as early as possible to avoid any issues that may come up in receiving regular checks.</p> 

<p>Because tax filing companies neglected to alter their algorithm to check whether or not someone’s income was coming from Pandemic Unemployment Compensation, I and many others owed thousands of dollars in taxes for money that was issued by the same government I was being paid by. In addition, the algorithm determined I was generating enough income to be “independent”, but because my mother had claimed me as her dependent, I was prompted to pay a large fee that makes up for the cuts she receives by claiming me. </p>

<p>The IRS realized this issue and eventually said that pandemic unemployment benefits were not taxable, and that the filing systems should now be fixed, but that left those who had already filed wondering where that money went. I did not receive my money back for 10 months after my taxes were filed. Overall, this issue speaks to how dangerous it is to use algorithms that oversimplify specific information. H&R Block and TurboTax work under the conditions that there isn’t a global pandemic in progress, but if these changes are unaccounted for, large populations of people are hurt fininacially by trying to do the right thing. </p>
