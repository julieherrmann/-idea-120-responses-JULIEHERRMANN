# James Bridle Response

<p> In Bridle's article, he discusses that lack of filters put in place, by humans and algorithms alike, to censor out potentially harmful content that is being marketed to children online. Like Bridle, I myself have had access to the internet from a young age and would not want to be a hypocrite by not allowing my future children to explore the web the way I did, but the web I grew up with is completely different from the internet that Gen Alpha is dealing with today. I agree that the vision Birdle sets out for what the internet should be, a place where the user has trust in platforms and their content to not exploit, harm, or abuse those engaging, but I dont believe that Bridle lays out a solution.

  <p> Bridle argues that because this content is being made at such critical mass, with an array of "word salads" that not only fly past content filters but end up as suggested content for children, it is nearly impossible to offer a solution without completely overhauling the entire platform. The amount of humans it would take to sift through videos that are titled inoocently that contain innapropriate content is unimaginable, and the algorithms in place at Bridle's time of writing were not privy to identitfying harmful videos or asserting appropriate copyright restrictions on copied content; in addition, even trying to censor some of this content may infringe upon the idea of open-access internet and dempocratic free speech. However, I do believe that Bridle's focus on the string of suggested kids content speaks to the larger issues of social media echochambers that we are all subject to. Just like kids that want to watch Peppa Pig on Youtube end up watching knock-off Peppa Pig commit assault, adults will go online expecting to watch a video on the latest news, and before you know it they've been algorithmically funneled into a white supremacy alt-right podcast. Though I or Bridle don't have a definite solution to this, it serves as an important reminder that we all need to remain critical and skeptical of the content we are served via the "Recommended " tab, and continuouslky question if our "interests" are genuine or heavily influenced. </P>
