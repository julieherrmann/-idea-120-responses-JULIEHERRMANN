# Accesibility of Gaming
<p> In Anna Anthropy's "Rise of the Videogame Zinesters", she discusses the varying problems of accesibility the video game world has in regards to their production, marketing, playability, demographic, and content. Because the majority of popular video games have been produced by young, white, male coders, the sociological positioning of the creators reflects that of their audience. Since this demographic typically has disposable income and free time to complete video games, they are more likely to return as consumers, resulting in companies creating more games that appeal to this narrow audience since the formula is successful. The problem with this is that it creates an echochamber in gaming communities, effectively ignoring the experiences of others outside of the white male audience. </p>
<P>Anthrophy also states that even games that include queer and/or female characters are typically written by men, for men. Rather than humanizing the experiences of those outside of the straight male audience, they become the subject of the male gaze, written in a two dimensional fashion as an object of aesthetic consumption. Further, because of the perpetual cycle of exclusion in gaming communities, it has become harder for outsider groups to create games for those like themselves. Anthropy states that she herself has created games using platforms that make game creation easier for those who are not well-versed in code, but even still, these games oftentimes do not enter the populus due to the target creator-audience group. </P>
<P> In agreeance with Anthropy, I feel that the video game community in all of it's facets has been gatekept and inaccesible in a number of ways. Not only do I, as a queer person, have no desire to enter into potentially threatening male-dominated spaces, but I do not find "shoot-men-in-the-face" games exciting or interesting to me. Even though there are creators like Anthropy creating game narratives that my demographic may find engaging, the popular understanding of gaming culture is enough to keep people like myself away from gameplay entirely. Anthropy brings up the evolution of the game controller as an example of how one has to be familiar with what controllers came before to be able to understand and operate new models, which further distances anyone new from entering the space.</P>
<p> In all, I believe that one of the ways to get a larger number of voices to participate in games, whether gameplay or game creation, is to foster a culture where the young, white, male demographic becomes more open to playing games that deviate from their desired narrative. It's a huge ask to do away with what has make video game companies money and what has made the average player comfortable, but since they control the market, its high time that other narratives enter the popular space.</p>
