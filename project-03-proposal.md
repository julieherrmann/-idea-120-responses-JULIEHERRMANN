# Project 3 Proposal 
<p> For my Twine game, I plan on creating a non-linear narrative to create a Pandemic Simulator with multiple branching story lines depending on one's choices to go out or quarantine. Although we are to avoid a "life simulator", I feel that the pandemic has presented us with a multitude of different ethical condundrums in regards to seeing friends, having a certain job, traveling, going grocery shopping, etc. and the ever-changing devlopments will serve as a disorienting time-jumping situation that will guide the events out of chronological order. For example, "It's July 17th 2020. You haven't seen any of your friends in nearly 6 months but Tracy's 21st birthday is just around the corner. You miss her dearly, and find out that she's planning a party. Do you RSVP or deny the invitation?" Option one leads to " Two weeks later, you arrive at Tracy's party wearing a mask. You notice that no one else is wearing a mask, and you almost feel embarrased but you want to stay safe. Do you let loose and unmask or keep it on?" Option two would lead to "Two weeks later, you're laying in bed scrolling instagram. You see that Tracy is posting pictures from her birthday party, but no one is wearing a mask. Are you glad you stayed safe at home, or are you experiencing FOMO?" and the tale continues based on the choice of the risk of experiencing life versus saving your life. </p>
<p>This game will contain multiple characters and the events will appear out of order as a result of the underlying narrative that the player is time traveling. Different choices will be rewarded or punished based on what stage of the pandemic the character is set in, ie, what are the reprecussions if you forget your mask to go grocery shopping in August of 2021 versus August of 2020? Because health mandates have changed so much over the last few years, this game will be a test of one's memory of the state of the world at the time that the event is taking place. </P>
