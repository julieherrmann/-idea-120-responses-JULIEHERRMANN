# Interactive Media
<p> When Nakamura discusses Manovich's regard for interactive media's ask of us to identify with someone else's mental structure, she alludes to the ways in which the platforms we engage with are designed for the user to follow preprogrammed decisions. In this way, we as users identify with what is presented to us, and go about exploring in a way that feels open and limitless because we are the ones interacting, but nonetheless, our actions are predetermined by the designer of the interface. For example, when I click through Instagram stories to see my friends' updates on their life, I feel as if I am choosing to check in on my loved ones since I clicked the buttons, but because of the way that instagram is designed, this notion is false. </p>
  <p>Instagram automatically times out stories to a certain number of seconds, autoplays the next person's story, and splices ads in between, so I'm never actually given the choice of free interaction since the design of the app is meant to leave the stress of decision-making out of my hands. This is what Nakamura means by the myth of interactivity; Our potential actions as users are considered in the design of interactive media, therefore, the platform presents the illusion of choice based on the idea that every user is alike, hence Manovich's refernence to someone else's mental structure. As the user, you are an imagined consideration based on what someone's perception of media consumers might be, and these platforms ask us to be that person for the program to work. <p>
