# Image Response - FitTea Influencer Ads
<p> The type of image I chose was the collection of instagram influencer ads for "FitTea", advertised as a diet drink for detoxing, debloating, and replacing your morning cup of coffee. The way the ads are marketed utilizes models and celebrities with desirable body types to push their product, oftentimes smiling, working out, and holding up the product. This is the denoted message, that celebrities are using the product and many people endorse the product.</p>
 <p> The linguistic message is the brand name FitTea, which is very striaghtforward, letting the consumer know that this is a type of tea that will make you fit. The product also states the word "28 day detox" on the bag. Another form of linguistic message is the cpation on these images, which varies depending on the person posting. Most times it will name drop the celebrity advertising for them, or say something more general like "Supports metabolism, Boosts Energy, Tastes great! Made in the USA! Order Fit Tea today! Link in our bio @FitTea", overall utilizing short, positive, phrases to capture the consumers attention and make the product more desirable</p>
 <p> The symbolic and connotated message is that the reason these people are in great shape is due to the success of the product. It's implied that because this brand has so many famous celebrities and attractive people promoting their brand, that they must be legitimate. The linguistic messages support the idea this is a product that you can try for less than a month and see results. The way that many of the images are taken at home with a cell phone rather than a professional camera implies that these are real customers, in attempt to make the ad not seem like an ad. </P>
 </P> I feel that these types of images would be different if presented as advertisements on a billboard, rather than instagram. Instagram is a social app that breeds self-consciousness, insecurity, comparison to other people's lives, etc. and the idea of seeing a slew of hot models drinking a diet tea on this type of platform caters to those that feel insecure as a result of instagram, more likely to buy the product. If these images were presented on a billboard, their "authentic" and "at-home" feel would fall flat and look unprofessional, since we expect humans on instagram and staged advertisements on billboards.</p>
