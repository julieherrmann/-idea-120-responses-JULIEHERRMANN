#Gesamkunstwerk & Ryan Trecartin

<p>  Gesamkunstwerk is understood to be a total and complete work of art, utilizing multiple forms of expression that cater to the entire human sensorium. By combining elements of rhetoric, painting, sculpture, music, and performance, the spectator is able to enter an all-encompassing creative environment appealing to the emotions while leaving rationality and reality behind. “Entangled” by Chris Salter references the evolution of performance through examples of gesamkunstwerk such as  dadasism and constructivism, two art movements that went to absurd and impossible extremes to emphasize that art was more than what existed on the surface; it was theoretical, imaginary, and irrational.  In contemporary contexts, it’s difficult to imagine a successful all-encompassing artwork when modern society now expects shocking sensory overload from all forms of media. However, one example of a Gesamkunstwerk that can be found under the umbrella of Net.Art is Ryan Trecartin’s video works, including the series I-Be Area(2008.) </p>
  <p>By overwhelming the viewer with nearly indescernible pitched-up dialogue, everchanging saturated hues, and disorienting zoom angles, Trecartin’s video style puts the viewer in an anxious state, unsure if they should continue watching or look away. The subject matter is not inherently explicit or violent, but skates on the edge of being unbearable by means of how overwhelming the entire experience it. I had the pleasure of viewing Trecartin’s work in person a few years ago, where a few video projects played in succession in a dark room off the edge of the gallery. By entering an art space to view a video work, the audience members assumes that the video will loop over in a reasonable amount of time, and that they should leave the space once the video gets to the point they walked in on. However, Trecartin’s whiplash inducing editing style combined with his choice to produce long-form video in a hypnotizing soundscape makes the audience feel as though they can’t leave: the video seems to never end while constantly repeating. I feel that Treacrtin emblemizes the Gesamkunstwerk by converging expectations of character performance, set design, costume, music, dialogue, and endurance in a way that speaks to the hyperreal internet culture that we exist within today.  </p>
