# Murray and The Future of Television
<p> With some exceptions, I believe that Murray's predicitions about the merging between the internet and television were fairly accurate. She states that in time, telelvision will allow audiences to point and click their way across the screen, "even sneding emails from an ordinary phone line." Though the language is not exact and the media at her disposable to observe was limited to what has actually developed, she has still accurately envisioned the Smart TV, choose-your-adventure shows, and the smartphone. She explores the idea of immersion and interactivity with digital media, and a great example of how that has developed is the way that the Mandalorian production crew is utilizing LCD screens for real-time backdrop placement to shoot their show. By immersing actors within the imagined enviroment that would typically be added in post-production on top of green screen, the actors are able to visually understand their set, and the light from the screens reflecting on objects creates a visual that mirrors reality more closely.
